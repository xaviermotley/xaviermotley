# Security Operating Model

## Mission
Our mission is to build and operate security programs that enable the organization to innovate boldly while safeguarding people, data, and products. Security should accelerate the business, not slow it down.

## Guiding Principles
- **Business enablement** – security serves as an enabler, providing guardrails that let teams move quickly and safely.
- **Risk-based decisions** – prioritize work based on measurable risk, aligning with business priorities and tolerance.
- **Automation and scalability** – design controls that are automated, repeatable, and scalable across all environments.
- **Transparency and collaboration** – work in the open with engineering, product, legal, and creative teams to build trust and shared ownership.
- **Continuous improvement** – learn from incidents, tests, and emerging threats to evolve the program over time.

## Organizational Structure
The operating model is structured around clear accountability and cross-functional integration:

- **Executive leadership** – the Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) or equivalent role owns overall security strategy and risk.
- **Core security functions** – program management, governance/risk/compliance, identity & access management, infrastructure and platform security, application and product security, data protection, content and creative pipeline security, AI/ML security, and incident response.
- **Embedded security partners** – security leads embedded with engineering, product, and creative teams ensure security is considered early in design and development.
- **Security champions network** – a distributed network of trained champions within each business unit promotes security culture and acts as first responders.

## Functional Domains
This model covers the full security lifecycle. Key domains include:

- Governance, risk, and compliance (GRC)
- Identity and access management (IAM)
- Infrastructure and platform security
- Application and product security
- Data protection and privacy
- Content security and creative pipeline protection
- AI/ML and emerging technologies security
- Incident response and crisis leadership
- Threat intelligence and detection engineering
- Vendor and supply chain security

Each domain has a clear owner, defined objectives, and measurable outcomes that roll up to the overall program.

## Processes and Governance
Effective security requires repeatable processes:

- **Risk assessment and prioritization** – maintain an up-to-date risk register and use frameworks like ISO 27000, NIST CSF, and the AI Risk Management Framework to guide investments.
- **Policy and standards management** – define policies that align with business goals; review and refresh them regularly.
- **Secure development lifecycle** – integrate threat modeling, secure coding, and automated testing into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Access control and zero trust** – implement least privilege, continuous authentication, and context-aware authorization.
- **Third-party risk management** – assess vendors and partners, ensuring contract requirements and ongoing monitoring.
- **Security awareness and training** – educate employees and contractors regularly, tailored to their roles.
- **Continuous monitoring** – use detection engineering, logging, and metrics to monitor compliance and detect anomalies.

## Integration with Business Units
Security is most effective when embedded within the business:

- Align security objectives with product roadmaps and creative pipelines.
- Include security in planning and design reviews.
- Provide self-service tooling and consultation to remove friction for engineers and creators.
- Maintain regular communication with legal, privacy, finance, and executive stakeholders.

## Metrics and Key Performance Indicators
Track progress and communicate impact through clear metrics:

- Mean time to detect (MTTD) and mean time to respond (MTTR) to incidents.
- Time to remediate critical vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- Percentage of workloads covered by automated security controls.
- Completion rates for required training and champion programs.
- Audit and compliance pass rates.
- Reduction in high-risk findings quarter over quarter.

## Continuous Improvement
A good security operating model evolves:

- Conduct quarterly reviews of program performance and emerging threats.
- Perform post-mortems after incidents and major projects to capture lessons learned.
- Iterate on processes and tooling based on feedback and data.
- Encourage innovation, research, and contributions from all employees to improve security.
