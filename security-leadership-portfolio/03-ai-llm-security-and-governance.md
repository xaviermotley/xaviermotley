# AI/LLM Security & Governance

## Mission
My mission is to ensure that artificial intelligence and machine learning systems are designed, developed, deployed, and operated securely and ethically, enabling innovation while protecting people, data, and intellectual property.

## Guiding Principles
- **Safety and reliability** – I prioritize model safety, robustness, and resilience against adversarial attacks and misuse.
- **Transparency and explainability** – I advocate for clear understanding of model behavior, limitations, and decision-making processes.
- **Fairness and accountability** – I work to identify and mitigate bias, ensure fairness, and maintain accountability for outcomes.
- **Privacy and data protection** – I enforce privacy-preserving techniques and protect training and inference data.
- **Compliance and governance** – I align AI practices with emerging regulations and ethical standards.

## Threat Modeling and Risk Assessment
I conduct AI-specific threat modeling to identify potential attacks such as model poisoning, data exfiltration, prompt injection, and model inversion. I assess risks across the AI/ML lifecycle and prioritize mitigations based on impact and likelihood.

## Secure Development and MLOps
I integrate security into the AI/ML development pipeline, including:
- Secure coding practices for model code and infrastructure.
- Version control and provenance tracking for datasets and models.
- Automated testing for bias, drift, and adversarial robustness.
- Secure artifacts storage and access controls for model artifacts.
- Signed and validated model packages.

## Red Teaming and Evals
I design and run red-teaming exercises and adversarial evaluations to test models against abuse scenarios. I leverage evaluation frameworks to assess safety, harmful content generation, and prompt injection resilience. I use results to inform mitigations and release decisions.

## Model Release and Governance
I establish gate reviews for model releases that evaluate safety, fairness, privacy, and compliance criteria. I maintain a model registry with metadata, risk classifications, and usage restrictions. I create playbooks for decommissioning or rolling back models when issues arise.

## Data Privacy and Protection
I ensure training data is collected and used in compliance with privacy laws. I implement techniques such as data minimization, anonymization, synthetic data generation, and differential privacy. I protect embeddings and inference data through encryption and access controls.

## Monitoring and Detection
I deploy monitoring to detect model misuse, drift, and anomalies in production. I integrate logging for model inputs and outputs, with safeguards for privacy. I respond to incidents involving AI/ML systems using defined incident response processes.

## Supply Chain Security
I vet and monitor third-party models, libraries, and datasets. I verify the integrity of pre-trained models and ensure they are sourced from trusted providers. I manage vulnerabilities in AI frameworks and dependencies.

## Regulatory and Ethical Alignment
I stay abreast of evolving AI regulations and ethical guidelines (e.g., EU AI Act, NIST AI RMF). I work with legal and policy teams to ensure compliance and contribute to responsible AI governance across the organization.
