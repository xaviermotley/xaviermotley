# 90-Day Executive Plans (Creative, AI, Research & Engineering-Driven Organizations)

## My Mission
My mission in the first 90 days of any leadership role is to quickly assess, stabilize, and elevate the organization’s security posture while building trust with stakeholders. I focus on understanding the business, identifying critical risks, achieving early wins, and laying the foundation for long-term success across creative, AI, research, and engineering-driven environments.

## Guiding Principles
- **Listen & Learn** – I spend the early days gathering context, meeting people, and understanding current processes before making major changes.
- **Quick Wins + Long-Term Vision** – I balance immediate improvements with strategic planning to show momentum and credibility.
- **Business Alignment** – I align security initiatives with the organization’s mission, goals, and constraints.
- **Transparency & Communication** – I communicate progress, challenges, and priorities openly with executives and teams.
- **Empowerment** – I involve team members in planning and execution, fostering ownership and shared responsibility.

## 0‑30 Days: Assess & Build Relationships
- Meet with key stakeholders (engineering leads, product managers, creative teams, AI researchers, legal, compliance, and executives) to understand goals and pain points.
- Review existing security policies, architecture, incident history, vendor landscape, and ongoing initiatives.
- Conduct a high-level risk assessment to identify critical exposures (e.g., content leakage, data privacy gaps, model misuses, research IP protection).
- Identify and implement a few quick wins (e.g., enable MFA everywhere, close obvious misconfigurations, communicate basic security hygiene).
- Establish regular communication channels (Slack/Teams, weekly syncs) with security team and partners.
- Begin building trust by being present, listening, and responding promptly to issues.

## 30‑60 Days: Define Strategy & Prioritize
- Develop a concise security vision and strategy aligned with business objectives; validate it with leadership.
- Define a high-level operating model and org structure needed to support the strategy.
- Prioritize the top risks and opportunities discovered in the assessment, and draft a remediation/initiative roadmap.
- Establish baseline metrics for security posture (e.g., incident mean time to detect/respond, vulnerability remediation rates, compliance status).
- Socialize the plan with stakeholders, gather feedback, and adjust accordingly.
- Start addressing high-priority gaps (e.g., vendor assessments, code review processes, data classification framework).

## 60‑90 Days: Execute & Communicate
- Launch initial initiatives identified in the roadmap (e.g., content security lab setup, AI model governance, vulnerability management improvements).
- Formalize the security program charter and secure executive sponsorship and funding.
- Begin hiring or reallocating resources according to the proposed org design.
- Deliver early results and demonstrate progress against baseline metrics.
- Prepare a detailed multi-year security roadmap with milestones, resource needs, and expected outcomes.
- Present findings, strategy, and early accomplishments to the board or executive committee.

## Domain-Specific Focus Areas

### Creative Organizations
- Assess the security of content creation pipelines, including production, post-production, VFX, and distribution.
- Evaluate vendor and partner security practices; implement or enhance vendor onboarding and risk management.
- Develop or refine digital asset management controls (watermarking, encryption, access controls) to protect pre-release content.
- Train creative teams on secure collaboration practices and incident reporting.

### AI-Driven Organizations
- Review AI/ML development lifecycle (data collection, labeling, training, deployment) for security and privacy risks.
- Conduct initial threat modeling and red-teaming exercises on high-impact models.
- Validate compliance with AI ethics, privacy, and security frameworks (e.g., NIST AI RMF).
- Define governance around model access, release procedures, and monitoring for misuse or drift.

### Research Institutions
- Identify and categorize sensitive research data and intellectual property; implement appropriate protections.
- Develop policies for open vs. restricted data sharing and collaboration with external partners.
- Ensure compliance with relevant regulations (e.g., IRB, export controls) while enabling scientific progress.
- Engage researchers to build a culture of security awareness without hindering innovation.

### Engineering-Driven Organizations
- Evaluate and enhance secure software development practices (e.g., threat modeling, code scanning, secure coding standards).
- Integrate security into CI/CD pipelines and infrastructure-as-code.
- Implement or improve detection and response mechanisms in staging and production environments.
- Provide developers with training, tools, and templates to embed security earlier in the lifecycle.

## Metrics & Feedback
I monitor progress through metrics such as:
- Completion of planned initiatives vs. timeline.
- Reduction in critical vulnerabilities or incident frequency.
- Improvement in security maturity scores or compliance audit results.
- Stakeholder satisfaction and qualitative feedback.
These metrics guide adjustments to the plan and help maintain accountability.
