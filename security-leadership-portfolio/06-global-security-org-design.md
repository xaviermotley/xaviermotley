# Global Security Org Design

## My Mission
My mission is to build and evolve a security organization that is agile, scalable, and aligned with the company’s strategic goals, enabling teams around the world to innovate safely and efficiently.

## Guiding Principles
- **Alignment with Business Structure** – I design the security organization to mirror and support the company’s product, engineering, and geographic structure.
- **Centralized Strategy, Decentralized Execution** – I set global standards and policies while empowering regional and business-unit teams to implement controls locally.
- **Talent Diversity & Inclusion** – I recruit and develop people with varied backgrounds, disciplines, and perspectives to foster creativity and resilience.
- **Operational Excellence** – I define clear roles, responsibilities, and processes to avoid gaps and overlaps, and I use automation to handle repetitive tasks.
- **Scalability** – I ensure the organization can grow with the business, adding capabilities and capacity without bureaucratic bloat.

## Organizational Structure
I structure my security organization into key functional domains that align with enterprise needs, such as:

- **Security Architecture & Engineering** – Design secure systems, review new technologies, and drive secure-by-design initiatives.
- **Security Operations & Incident Response** – Monitor for threats, manage detections, respond to incidents, and coordinate crisis management.
- **GRC & Risk Management** – Oversee compliance, policy, risk assessments, audits, and third-party risk.
- **Product & Application Security** – Embed security in SDLC, partner with development teams, and run bug bounty programs.
- **Data Protection & Privacy** – Govern data classification, encryption, retention, and privacy compliance across the organization.
- **Content & Media Security** (for creative organizations) – Protect media assets and production pipelines.
- **AI/ML Security** – Ensure AI systems are safe, fair, and resilient.
- **Field & Physical Security** – Coordinate with facilities to secure physical assets and IoT/OT systems (when relevant).

Depending on the company’s size, I may combine or separate these domains and create matrixed relationships with business units.

## Governance and Leadership Roles
I define leadership roles such as Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), Deputy CISO, Directors/Managers for each domain, and regional security leads. I establish a security steering committee with representatives from engineering, product, legal, HR, and operations to review strategy, priorities, and budget. I ensure that security has a voice at the executive table and aligns with corporate governance.

## Hiring & Talent Development
I build hiring profiles for each role, focusing on curiosity, communication, and adaptability alongside technical skills. I create career pathways that allow specialists to grow as experts or leaders. I invest in training, mentoring, and rotating assignments to develop well-rounded security professionals. I promote diversity and belonging to foster a supportive culture.

## Collaboration with Other Functions
I embed security champions within engineering and product teams, and I establish liaisons with legal, compliance, HR, and communications. I participate in architecture reviews, product development cycles, and strategy planning to ensure security requirements are considered early.

## Metrics & Continuous Improvement
I measure organizational health through metrics like team satisfaction, turnover rates, time to fill positions, training completion, and internal mobility. I track operational metrics (e.g., incident count, vulnerabilities remediated) at a domain level. I review the org design periodically to adjust as the business evolves, incorporating feedback from stakeholders and lessons from incidents.
